# DSA210Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationship between my personal Twitter engagement and significant socio-political and natural events, focusing on:
1.	Two major election days.
2.	The February 6th earthquake in Turkey.

The goal is to uncover patterns in my Twitter activity, such as tweeting, retweeting, and engagement levels, and to explore correlations with public sentiment and trends during these critical events.

## Motivation

As an active Twitter user, I’ve observed how my activity fluctuates during key socio-political and natural events, such as elections and disasters. This project is driven by my curiosity to explore how my Twitter usage correlates with such events and to understand the broader implications of digital engagement during crises. By analyzing this data, I hope to gain insights into how individuals like myself interact with critical moments in history, contributing to the larger discourse on the role of social media in modern society.

## Dataset

__Personal Twitter Data__

Source: My personal Twitter archive, which includes:
* Tweets
*	Retweets
* Engagement patterns (excluding likes due to accessibility limitations)

__Limitations__

*	Lack of timestamps for liked tweets, which restricts the analysis of passive engagement.
*	Focus on personal data, making conclusions specific to my activity rather than generalized.

## Project Idea and Plan

__Research Question__

How does my personal Twitter activity correlate with significant political and natural events?

__Plan__

1.	Data Preparation:
*	Extract and preprocess data from my Twitter archive.
2.	Analysis:
*	Compare Twitter activity on special days to baseline periods (e.g., ±60 days).
* Perform sentiment analysis on tweets to detect shifts in tone during these events.
*	Identify trends and spikes in activity.
3.	Visualization:
*	Create graphs showing activity levels (tweets, retweets) across time.
*	Highlight key patterns during the events.
4.	Insights:
*	Explore how personal engagement aligns with broader public trends and sentiments.

__Deliverables__

* Modified datasets (due to privacy concerns).
* Visualizations highlighting engagement patterns.
* Report summarizing findings and insights.

## Progress Monitoring

Regular updates will be made to this repository, including:
* Data preprocessing scripts.
* Analysis notebooks.
* Visualizations and results.
